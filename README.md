# 🌆 BritCity Score Website 🏙️

> A collaborative front-end web project showcasing scores and vibes from British cities — from iconic skylines to seaside charm!

## 🎨 Project Overview

This project is a playful, city-themed website that highlights different UK cities and scores them based on various fun criteria like vibes, views, and weather (we still gave some points for that 😅).

Each city has its own themed page, and users can explore ratings, images, and facts with a clean, responsive design.

## 🛠️ My Contributions

As part of a team of aspiring web developers, I focused on:

- ✨ **Front Page Design**:  
  - Created a welcoming, navigable homepage with clear links to city pages.
  - Added stylish visuals, icons, and layout elements using HTML and CSS.

- 🌊 **Southend-on-Sea Page**:  
  - Designed and styled the page content, integrating city facts and score categories.
  - Collaborated with team members to keep the visual theme consistent.
  - Used fun local features like piers and fish & chips 🐟🍟 as part of the vibe!

## 🧑‍💻 Team Collaboration

This was part of a **Code First Girls Web Development course**, where we collaborated in small teams to design and build a real website together.  
It was a fantastic intro to:
- Version control with Git
- Project planning & peer review
- Collaborative coding using GitHub

---

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add mobile responsiveness for all city pages
- Animate city scores or visuals with JavaScript
- Integrate a fun quiz: “Which UK city matches your vibe?”
